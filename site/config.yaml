    Title: Welcome to the Tensor Collective
    Content: Hi! I'm Jasper, I'm a finalist at Oxford studying Chemistry. TTC is a technical blog of mine for machine learning. 
    I'm currently working in machine learning applications for Chemistry. I launched TTC in December 2023, for a few reasons;
    I believe sharing failures is just as important as sharing successes, especially in ML. 
    In ML literature, however, you'll only find the methods that worked and struggle to get the in-depth lessons the scientists truly learned.
    This place serves as a log of some of my notes, writing challenges me
    to be more concise and clear in my thinking which hopefully is benefit to both of us!
    I often find articles and guides to be devoid of passion for the subject; it's difficult to be precise, elegant and rigorous at the same time.
    With less focus on mathematical rigour, I aim to give an imaginative perspective into ML for the sciences, 
    bridging the gap between deeply technical concepts and the ones more familiar to us scientists.
    Please do reach out if you have any questions / corrections, I hope you find some useful articles!
