    Title: Welcome to the Tensor Collective
    Content: TTC is a technical blog of mine for machine learning. 
      I'm a soon-to-be PhD student in machine learning, having pivoted from being
      self-taught in ML for Chemistry. 
      I launched TTC in December 2023, for a few reasons;
      Firstly, I believe there's a place for honest documentation and showcase
      of projects and ideas, in less serious settings than my academic work.
      Secondly, this place serves as a log of some of my notes, writing challenges me
      to be more concise and clear in my thinking.
      Lastly, I often find articles and guides to be devoid of 
      passion for the subject, and I hope to put slightly less focus on rigour
      and more on telling a captivating story with my articles.
      Please do reach out if you have any questions, I hope you enjoy the articles!
