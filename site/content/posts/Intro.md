# The Tensor Collective
Welcome to The Tensor Collective - A blog dedicated to bridging scientists into machine learning. Here, you'll find everything you need to know about our blog!

Machine learning is inherently simple. Take a random matrix, apply it to your input and calculate a number that is proportional to how close you are to your target for said input. Now use an automatic differentiation package to calculate how much you need to change the parameters to get a better model. Repeat this enough times and you can achieve something like a 90% accuracy when recognising hand-drawn images.


Many of the intimidating concepts in ML don't require degrees in mathematics and statistics to grasp. Better yet, as we embrace the tools of today it helps to understand their technical grounding. With our articles, we bridge the gap between technical aspects and the user experience of these applications. 


We cover concepts in more extraneous domains too, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning. Domains rich in application but due to their complexity have perhaps not received as much public attention. We hope to bridge the gap between the technical domains of ML and both the prospects of a revolutionised society and the fears concerning the ongoing rapid race to the bottom for AGI. We bring to light issues that have arisen from the race to state-of-the-art (SOTA) that propagates much of academia, and highlight the true lessons we learn from the progress of the greatest models we use today.


**Our Motivation: Bridging the Gap between STEM and Robust AI** We recognize that robust AI algorithms are complex, and deep understanding of the underlying principles and limitations. AI today sways from a force to fear to a chatbot that can't help but correct itself. 

**Clarity in Communication: The Heart of Our Content** Our posts are crafted to break down technical aspects of AI into digestible, easy-to-understand essays with clear narratives.

**Visuals: Our dedicated approach** Great visualizations make an article, we spend a large amount of our time writing dedicated to creating clear visuals that follow a consistent and pleasant markdown.

## About the Author
I'm finishing my study of Chemistry at the University of Oxford this year. I pivoted to machine learning in recent years with a curiosity founded on how simple machine learning can be to it's core. We've seen lots of applications of ML, perhaps some would argue too many, and increasingly we've seen applications across scientific domains. I'm passionate to help other scientists bridge the gaps in their knowledge, like I've done myself, to reap the benefits of AI technologies and techniques.


My journey as a Chemist began with an infatuation for the vast complexity of chemical processes, and their wildly unpredictable behaviour. The Briggs-Rauscher displays oscillating changes between vibrant shades of blue and pale yellow, only explainable via a complex chain of interlinked single-step reactions. Algorithms capable of surpassing human-level identification are too, nothing more than a complex orchestration of simple building blocks; simple calculus and matrix products can get you to an accuracy of around 90% for looking at hand-drawn digits.
